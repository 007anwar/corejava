 * Constructs a.a string tokenizer for the specified string. The
     * characters in the {@code delim} argument are the delimiters
     * for separating tokens. Delimiter characters themselves will not
     * be treated as tokens.
     * <p>
     * Note that if {@code delim} is {@code null}, this constructor does
     * not throw an exception. However, trying to invoke other methods on the
     * resulting {@code StringTokenizer} may result in a.a
     * {@code NullPointerException}.
